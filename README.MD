# Daily Programming Problems
These are my solutions to the daily programming problems from a mailing list.

## Purpose
One of the most difficult (and possibly most cruel) parts of working in software development is the technical interview. Many consider the technical interview to be its own kind of skill, and thus it takes a certain kind of practice to help hone that skill. In order to make sure I do not get rusty with my abilities, and am able to show that I am employable, I will work on these daily programming problems. Plus, I like to do at least a little bit of programming every day, just to keep the juices flowing.

## Goal
There is not set goal of this repository except to be able to quickly go over problems and their solutions, as well as a location to store what I have worked on. For particularly interesting or difficult problems, I will include a write up.
